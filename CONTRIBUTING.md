## Glotter Development Environment

### Dependencies

Before you can build Glotter, there a few things you will need.

- Docker: Glotter makes extensive use of docker. You will need to have docker installed on your machine and configured to use linux containers if you are windows (this is the default as of writing).
- Python and Pip: Glotter is written in Python.
